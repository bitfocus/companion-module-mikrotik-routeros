# Module for Mikrotik RouterOS

* Would like to see;

* Port POE power on/off could be nice to reboot stuff
* Raw API commands + some fixed actions like "Disable interface" "Enable interface"
* it would be nice with a renew ip thing as well..
* if companion could renew and control inteface enable/disable, we could make a button that switches between 4G wan and cabled wan
